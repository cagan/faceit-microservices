# FACEIT User Microservice

## TODO:
- Brief explanation of the project
- Swagger Documentation
- Postman collection
- Document how to set up, run project
- Data migrations


## What would I implement if it was a real project?
- Outbox Pattern: I would implement Debezium with mongo connector and kafka in order to make sure that data is pushing safely.
- More tests, more coverage rate.
- Implementing security tools such as Spring Security.
